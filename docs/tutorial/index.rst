This tutorial will walk you through connecting and configuring a web service to Buildly Core. Users will be able to 
see all endpoints in one OpenAPI specification, use only one URL to request data from different services,
enable authentication and authorization.

It's assumed that you're already familiar with Docker, OpenAPI (old Swagger) and JWT.

While it's designed to give a good starting point, the tutorial doesn't cover all of Buildly Core's features.
